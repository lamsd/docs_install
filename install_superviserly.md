# Installing Supervisely on a Linux Server

This guide provides a general overview of installing Supervisely on a Linux server.  **It is crucial to consult the official Supervisely documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions.**  This guide is for informational purposes and may not cover all specific requirements or configurations.

## Prerequisites

* A Linux server (Ubuntu is recommended).
* Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server.
* Sufficient permissions to install and run services on the server.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Install Docker

If Docker is not already installed, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
curl -fsSL [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg) | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu) $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
```
### 2. Install Docker Compose
Install Docker Compose using the following command:
```bash
sudo curl -L "[https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-<span class="math-inline">\(uname\]\(https\://github\.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1\.29\.2/docker\-compose\-</span>(uname) -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```
(Note:  Replace 1.29.2 with the latest stable Docker Compose version if necessary. Check the Docker Compose releases on GitHub for the current version.)

### 3. Clone the Supervisely Repository (If Applicable)
Supervisely may provide a Docker Compose setup within a repository. If so, clone it:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely.git](https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely.git)  # Replace with the actual repository URL
cd supervisely
```
(Important: The correct repository URL should be obtained from the official Supervisely documentation.)

### 4. Configure Environment
Before starting the installation, configure any necessary environment variables or .env files. This is crucial and will be specific to your Supervisely setup.  Refer to the official Supervisely documentation for detailed instructions on configuring settings like database passwords, API keys, and other required parameters.

### 5. Run Docker Compose
Once the environment is configured, start Supervisely using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
### 6. Verify Installation
After the containers are running, verify the installation by accessing the Supervisely web interface. This is typically done through your server's IP address and the configured port.  Consult the Supervisely documentation for the correct URL and port.

Post-Installation Steps
Reverse Proxy (Recommended): Set up a reverse proxy using Nginx or another web server for improved security and performance.
SSL/TLS (Essential): Configure SSL/TLS to encrypt communication and secure the connection.
Firewall: Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the server and only allow necessary ports.
Documentation and Support
Always refer to the official Supervisely documentation for the most accurate and detailed installation instructions.  The documentation will provide specific steps, configurations, and troubleshooting tips tailored to the current version of Supervisely.  Contact Supervisely support if you encounter any issues.
